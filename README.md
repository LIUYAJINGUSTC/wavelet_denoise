# wavelet_denoise
This work is based on caffe.Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and community contributors.
# Firstï¼Œwe use wavelet decomposition image into four domains.Then we put all of them into in the network to make them study from each other.
